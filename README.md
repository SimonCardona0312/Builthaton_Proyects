File Uploads: Supports mp3, mp4, wav, m4a, and opus formats.


Automatic Transcription: Audio processing powered by the Whisper base model.


Generative AI Slides: Automatically creates titles, bullet points, and detailed speaker notes.


Language Enforcement: The AI identifies the source language and generates all content in that same language.


Multi-Format Export: Download your results as .pptx (PowerPoint) or .pdf files.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: Streamlit 


AI Models: * OpenAI Whisper: For speech-to-text transcription.


Google Gemini 2.0 Flash: For slide structuring and content synthesis.

Document Processing:

📝 Structure & Logic
The app uses a strict prompt engineering approach to ensure that:

The output language matches the audio transcript exactly.

Slide content and speaker notes are clearly separated using custom regex patterns.

A minimum of 5 slides are generated if clear instructions are detected in the audio.
